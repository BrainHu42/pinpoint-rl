# Lessons

New lessons, one entry each (2-4 lines: the claim, the deciding numbers, the module). Lessons 1-137 are archived in
`docs/archive/LESSONS_1-137.md` (anchor `#lN` per lesson); their main points are in `LEARNINGS.md`. When a new lesson changes a main point,
update `LEARNINGS.md` too.

The two tracks run in parallel sessions (2026-10-20), so each numbers its own lessons and appends only to its own section: R1, R2, ...
for `RETRIEVAL_PLAN.md`, S1, S2, ... for `SEARCH_PLAN.md`. Later single-track work continues from 138.

## Retrieval track (R)
R1. **Retrieval misses are depth, not absence** (`retrieval_recall.py`; dev3k, released retriever, original protocol; exact rank of the best right
    index photo per search). Within 25 km: union 32 / 8 / 8 73.3 (= pool oracle 73.1), 8 / 2 / 2 59.8; per modality K = 64 / 256 / 1000:
    82.2 / 90.5 / 95.7; only 0.2% have no right index photo. Of the 26.7-pt miss, 8.9 / 17.2 / 22.4 pts return at K = 64 / 256 / 1000. No own photo
    in the pool (56%): 56.0 -> 70.4 / 84.1 / 92.8, best-modality rank median 11, p75 95 (with one: 0 / 2). Contrastive image search is first on
    63%, raw SigLIP2 adds 7.7% alone at top 32, GPS 0.9% (recall flat after K = 1: 32.2 -> 40.5 at 32, its hits pile onto one place). 1 km: 32 / 8 / 8
    52.3, K = 1000 80.6 (95.6% have a photo within 1 km). Own photos: 92% of photographers have one within 25 km of the truth in the index (76%
    within 1 km), 44% get one into the pool; removing them drops 32 / 8 / 8 to 63.6. Sparse gallery (< 100 photos within 25 km, 8%): 50.2, K = 1000 80.3.

## Search-agent track (S)
